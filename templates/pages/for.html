# Use cases for Datasette

Datasette can be applied to all kinds of interesting problems.

## [Exploratory data analysis](/for/exploratory-analysis)

`datasette publish` lets you instantly publish your data to hosting providers like Google Cloud Run, Heroku or Vercel.

## [Rapid prototyping](/for/rapid-prototyping)
