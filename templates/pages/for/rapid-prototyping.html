# Datasette for rapid prototyping

Want to build a prototype? Datasette lets you turn any source of data into a powerful JSON or [GraphQL](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql) API, ideal for use as the backend for an interactive prototype.

Use Datasette with **[Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/)** to quickly try out new visualizations and explore the Datasette API using JavaScript.

Datasette works as a great data for **[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)** too.

[Fast Autocomplete Search for Your Website](https://24ways.org/2018/fast-autocomplete-search-for-your-website/) shows how to build a full autocomplete search engine for your website, powered by Datasette and a few dozen lines of custom JavaScript.
